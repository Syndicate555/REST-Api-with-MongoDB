# REST API using Express and MongoDb
I created this RESTful api as part of the backend for my React project in a Hackathon. Expressjs and MongoDB was used to create it. The API also includes login and authentication for the Users. I used bcrypt to hash the passwords before saving them into the mongo database. For the authentication, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) were used to restrict access to an unrestricted route. I used POSTMAN for testing the functionality of the API during its development.
